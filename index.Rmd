# Welcome!

Thank you for joining me on a journey to explore the use of Open Data in the civic world.

The book is organized into 3 parts -

* Part 1 provides an overview of what Open Data is, how it is used and who uses it.
* Part 2 questions the usefulness of Open Data to its producers, how use is measured and what are the challenges faced by producers and consumers of it.
* Part 3 imagines how information provided by Open Data may be shared, discovered and improved.

I have had the great honor to work with many amazing organizations, agencies and governments to implement technology solutions that enabled the unleashing of data and analytics to power decision making and transparency.^[@blog5years] The purpose for this book is to synthesize what I have learned working in the field with customers and present examples and ideas to grow the Open Data ecosystem.
