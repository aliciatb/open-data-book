### Topics

Popular data topics include emergency calls for service, budget, revenue, expenditures, property tax, permits, food inspections, government service calls, lost and found pets, crime incidents, jail bookings, voting registration and election results. When this data includes date, time and location, it can be valuable for performance management and refining staffing for services. When it includes demographic information it makes it possible to analyze differences in data by gender, race and ethnicity, and age and can help inform where there should be more outreach and consider mode of communication that may be most effective.
