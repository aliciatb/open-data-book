## Measuring Use

* Utilization
* Analytics
* Feedback

1. Who are the real users of this data? 
2. How can we tell who they are? 
3. Are there personas we haven't imagined?
4. How can we measure actual engagement of these users? 
5. Are they using it the way we thought they were? Ex. Hack to "fix" data in between steps.

## Challenges of Open Data

### Searching for data

* Paging through results
* Onus of filtering

### Peeking at data
