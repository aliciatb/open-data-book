\chapter{Welcome!}\label{welcome}}

Thank you for joining me on a journey to explore the use of Open Data in the civic world.

The book is organized into 3 parts -

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Part 1 provides an overview of what Open Data is, how it is used and who uses it.
\item
  Part 2 questions the usefulness of Open Data to its producers, how use is measured and what are the challenges faced by producers and consumers of it.
\item
  Part 3 imagines how information provided by Open Data may be shared, discovered and improved.
\end{itemize}

I have had the great honor to work with many amazing organizations, agencies and governments to implement technology solutions that enabled the unleashing of data and analytics to power decision making and transparency.\footnote{\citet{blog5years}} The purpose for this book is to synthesize what I have learned working in the field with customers and present examples and ideas to grow the Open Data ecosystem.

\section{What is Open Data?}\label{what-is-open-data}}

\begin{quote}
``Open data is information or content made freely available to use and redistribute, subject only to the requirement to attribute it to the source.''

--- Gartner\footnote{\citet{gartner_opendata_def}}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{topics}{%
\subsection{Topics}\label{topics}}

Popular data topics include emergency calls for service, budget, revenue, expenditures, property tax, permits, food inspections, government service calls, lost and found pets, crime incidents, jail bookings, voting registration and election results. When this data includes date, time and location, it can be valuable for performance management and refining staffing for services. When it includes demographic information it makes it possible to analyze differences in data by gender, race and ethnicity, and age and can help inform where there should be more outreach and consider mode of communication that may be most effective.

There are many people and roles across organizations that require data. Here are some personas based on individuals I have met and worked with to get the data they need to perform their jobs. Please note that the names are made up and intended to reflect any specific gender.

Adding datasets to a platform may benefit power users of data and make it easy consumable by tools and programming languages. However data alone will not advance the knowledge of the community it is intended to serve without also including narrative and insights from the collections of datasets shared to a platform.
