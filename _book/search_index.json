Thank you for joining me on a journey to explore the use of Open Data in the civic world. The book is organized into 3 parts - Part 1 provides an overview of what Open Data is, how it is used and who uses it. Part 2 questions the usefulness of Open Data to its producers, how use is measured and what are the challenges faced by producers and consumers of it. Part 3 imagines how information provided by Open Data may be shared, discovered and improved. I have had the great honor to work with many amazing organizations, agencies and governments to implement technology solutions that enabled the unleashing of data and analytics to power decision making and transparency.1 The purpose for this book is to synthesize what I have learned working in the field with customers and present examples and ideas to grow the Open Data ecosystem.

When this data includes date, time and location, it can be valuable for performance management and refining staffing for services. When it includes demographic information it makes it possible to analyze differences in data by gender, race and ethnicity, and age and can help inform where there should be more outreach and consider mode of communication that may be most effective. 2.1.2 Types Tabular Spatial Dashboards Stories Visualizations Surveys Reports 2.2 How is it used? 2.2.1 Organizational Goals Public information Transparency Fine tune staffing and location Equity and performance measurement Insights and data mining 2.2.2 Civic Apps Contests 2.3 Who uses it? Producer organizations Community users (civic) Academic 2.3.1 Personas There are many people and roles across organizations that require data. Here are some personas based on individuals I have met and worked with to get the data they need to perform their jobs.

How can we tell who they are? Are there personas we haven’t imagined? How can we measure actual engagement of these users? Are they using it the way we thought they were? Ex.
